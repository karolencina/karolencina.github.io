        <li>
          <strong>Streamlined Source Configuration</strong>
          <p>I designed interfaces for creating, editing, viewing, and listing ingest points, supporting multiple
            protocols
            (RTP, SRT, Zixi). Advanced settings were simplified into intuitive forms with contextual help, reducing
            errors
            and setup time for technical users.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Efficient Contribution Management</strong>
          <p>Built flows for defining stream types, scheduling, redundancy, and profile locking. Both event-based and
            channel-based contributions were supported, helping operators manage multiple streams without conflicts
            and
            improving operational efficiency.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flexible Destination Setup</strong>
          <p>Created configuration interfaces for output endpoints with redundancy and failover logic. Users could
            easily
            handle pre-created and dynamic destinations, reducing misconfigurations and improving reliability.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Delivery Configuration with Clear Feedback</strong>
          <p>Designed the delivery setup to manage routing, transcoding, and cross-region delivery. Visual indicators
            highlighted redundancy, billing, and stream health, allowing operators to quickly detect and resolve
            issues.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Modular Stream Profile Design</strong>
          <p>Developed interfaces for defining stream parameters (resolution, codec, bitrate, framerate, GOP,
            colorspace).
            Profiles were reusable across workflows, which saved time and ensured consistency across the platform.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scalable Navigation & Menu System</strong>
          <p>Designed a navigation system to support complex operational workflows across multiple services. Patterns
            were
            built for scalability and modularity, ensuring that as new features were added, users could maintain
            efficiency
            and clarity.</p>

      <h2>Design Process</h2>
      <div class="workflow-card">
        <img class-"workflow-board" src="assets/img/media-interchange/workflow-board.webp"
          alt="Workflow board showing user flow for creating a media source" />
      </div>
      <h4>Auditing the Legacy Experience</h4>
      <p>The project began with a UX audit of the existing interfaces. I evaluated them against Jakob Nielsen’s
        heuristic
        principles to identify usability issues, inconsistencies, and accessibility gaps. This helped me frame the
        conversation
        with stakeholders not just around aesthetics, but also around usability and compliance including pushing for
        alignment
        with WCAG 3.0 guidelines where possible.</p>
      <h4>Collaborative Flow Mapping</h4>
      <p>To align design with how the system actually worked, the scrum team ran a workshop with key
        stakeholders.
        Together, we
        walked through critical user flows for core operational tasks. This uncovered hidden dependencies in backend
        logic,
        which influenced how the UI needed to guide users through complex decisions. Mapping these flows created a
        shared
        understanding across design, product, and engineering.</p>
      <h4>Turning Flows into Wireframes</h4>
      <p>With the flows clarified, I translated them into wireframes and prototypes for the most important screens.
        These
        prototypes weren’t just static mockups. They were clickable journeys that let us test the logic and
        interactions early,
        reducing the risk of rework later in development.</p>
      <h4>Testing and Iteration</h4>
      <p>Because the user base was highly specialised, we worked with a small but expert group of internal users. I
        conducted
        short interviews, collected feedback from our internal chat channels, and observed how they navigated the
        prototypes.
      </p>
      <p>I pushed for feedback during sprint reviews, ensuring that design work was visible and testable at each
        iteration.
        This kept stakeholders engaged, gave developers early visibility into upcoming UI patterns, and helped us
        validate
        design decisions before they became expensive to change.Many of the stakeholders were accustomed to more
        traditional, waterfall-style delivery, where design and
        development
        happened in silos. By integrating lightweight testing and iteration into the sprint cadence, I helped them
        experience
        the benefits of incremental improvements and reduced friction when handing off to engineering.</p>
      <h4>Bridging Design and Development</h4>
      <p>Throughout the process, I partnered closely with backend engineers to ensure the UI aligned with system logic.
        For
        example, some edge cases in operational flows required creative solutions that balanced technical constraints
        with user
        clarity.</p>
      <p>
        The design philosophy emphasised modularity, reusability, and scalability. Components and patterns were built to
        support company-wide adoption, laying the foundation for a unified design system before a formal design team was
        in place.
      </p>

    <section id="core-workflows">
      <h2>Designing Core Workflows</h2>
      <p>When I turned to the core operational pages, my goal was to design interfaces that could support a wide range
        of user workflows while staying consistent across the platform.
        Each service (Sources, Contributions, Destinations, Delivery, and Stream Profiles) shared a common set of
        actions:
      <ul>
        <li>Creating a record through structured forms.</li>
        <li>Reviewing a summary of entered data prior to submission.</li>
        <li>Accessing detailed pages to view or edit existing records.</li>
        <li>Navigating contribution lists to track and manage multiple entries.</li>
      </ul>
      By standardising these patterns across modules, users didn’t need to relearn interactions as they moved between
      services. This consistency reduced cognitive load, supported efficiency for expert users, and made the system
      easier to scale as new features were added.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="impact">
      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>
        The redesign significantly improved usability and efficiency for setting up streams and managing deliveries,
        reducing
        the time and cognitive load for expert users. New users experienced faster onboarding, while consistent patterns
        and
        modular workflows laid a strong foundation that the formal design team later scaled across the platform.
        Raising accessibility
        and usability standards improved inclusivity and minimised errors, and iterative collaboration
        with
        stakeholders became part of the sprint rhythm, helping the team embrace more modern, user-centered practices. On
        the
        technical side, the work contributed to a reusable React component library that is now being adopted across
        multiple
        products, enabling a more unified design system across the organization. Overall, the platform became more
        reliable,
        scalable, and user-friendly, setting the stage for future growth.
