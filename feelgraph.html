      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>
        Mental wellbeing is declining worldwide, particularly among young
        adults. Research shows that expressive writing (writing openly about our
        thoughts and feelings) can improve both emotional health, but manually
        analysing these entries is time-consuming, making it difficult for users
        to spot patterns in their moods.</p>
        <p><span class="problem-statement">Problem statement:</span> How can we create a
        tool that encourages expressive writing while helping users understand
        their mood patterns quickly and meaningfully?
        </p>
      </p>
      <p class="main-info">
        Feelgraph is a concept for a product that combines expressive writing with personal analytics, helping users reflect on their mood patterns through simple, clear data visualisation.

      <h2>My Role</h2>
        <h4>UX Research and UI Design</h4>
        <p>
  Research, wireframes, design system, high-fidelity prototype (Figma)
        </p>
        <h4>Development</h4>
        <p>
         Implemented a working iOS prototype with core features using Swift
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        I started designing the application by brainstorming and drawing out
        different ideas on paper. I came up with a lot of interesting features,
        but I didn't end up using all of them in the final version. The rough
        sketches I made were really helpful in figuring out what I wanted for
        the app. I used those sketches to make a digital version of the app
        using Figma, a high fidelity prototype. The digital version was built on
        top of the original sketches, and it turned out much better than I was
        expecting.

          Above is an interactive high-fidelity prototype of my project. It
          features a design based on research articles about colours and
          addresses sensitive data privacy issues by using biometric
          verification for every login.

      <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
      <p>
        A short elevatior pitch for my peers was part of the project. I prepared
        an presentation that outlined all the essential feature and value of the
        product.

      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        The project is presently under development. I have completed the
        literature review and research phases and am currently in the design
        stage. The development of the project has not yet commenced. Please
        check back in July for updates on the progress.
