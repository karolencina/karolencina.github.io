      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>
        Mental wellbeing is declining worldwide, particularly among young adults. Research shows that expressive writing
        — writing openly about our thoughts and feelings — can improve both emotional wellbeing and physical health.</p>
      <p>The challenge is that analysing diary entries manually is time-consuming, making it hard to identify patterns
        in mood and wellbeing.
      </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        Feelgraph is a concept for an iOS app that combines expressive writing with personal analytics, helping users
        reflect on their mood patterns through simple, clear data visualisation.

      <h2>Research & Insights</h2>
      <p>
        From the start, I wanted to make sure design decisions were grounded in real user needs, not just assumptions.
        To do this, I used a mixed-method approach that combined both quantitative and qualitative research - giving me
        the numbers to spot patterns and the stories to understand why those patterns mattered.
      </p>
      <h4>Competitive Analysis & Literature Review</h4>
      <p>I started by conducting competitive analysis and literature review to understand existing mood-tracking apps,
        identify common pain points, and explore best practices in expressive writing and personal analytics. This
        research revealed key gaps: many apps felt impersonal, overwhelming, or visually cluttered, and users were
        highly sensitive to privacy concerns. These findings helped define the core objectives for Feelgraph:
        simplicity, clarity, emotional support, and secure handling of personal data.
      </p>
      <h4>User Interviews & Surveys</h4>
      <p>
        With these insights, I moved into early design exploration, creating low-fidelity sketches and wireframes to
        experiment with layout, chart styles, and colour palettes. These early concepts were then tested through a
        structured online A/B questionnaire (Microsoft Forms), which provided quantitative feedback from a broad
        audience. The survey results informed which colour palettes, chart styles, and interface layouts resonated best
        with users. I also drew on psychological research on colour and mood, while carefully designing the survey to
        avoid order effects or priming biases. Participants were recruited via Instagram, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp, with
        additional responses collected through snowball sampling.
      </p>
      <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
      <p>
        Building on this feedback, I developed mid-fidelity wireframes and later high-fidelity interactive prototypes in
        Figma. These prototypes were tested in moderated usability sessions, where participants completed journaling and
        reflection tasks while I observed their interactions and asked follow-up questions. These sessions provided rich
        qualitative insights into usability, accessibility, and emotional resonance. One of the clearest takeaways was
        that users valued simplicity and supportive visuals over complex features, which directly influenced the final
        design choices.
      </p>
      <h4>Ethical Considerations</h4>
      <p>
        Ethics were an important consideration throughout. I secured ethical approval before starting, obtained informed
        consent from every participant, and intentionally avoided collecting unnecessary demographic or personal data.
        This kept the focus on behaviour and experience while respecting participants’ privacy. </p>
      </p>
      <h2 id="design">Design & Prototyping</h2>
      <h4>Ideation & Wireframing</h4>
      <p>
        With research insights, I began the ideation phase by sketching low-fidelity concepts on paper. These
        early sketches explored multiple layouts for mood tracking, journaling, and data visualization, allowing me to
        experiment freely without committing to a final structure. I focused on creating interfaces that were intuitive
        and emotionally supportive, keeping the user’s reflection and privacy needs at the forefront.

            guided the high-fidelity prototype.
          </figcaption>
        </div>
      </figure>
      <h4>Design System & Mid-Fidelity Prototyping</h4>
      <p>
        From the sketches, I developed mid-fidelity wireframes, introducing a clearer hierarchy of content, interactive
        elements, and chart visualizations. At this stage, I incorporated learnings from the A/B testing, including
        preferred colour palettes, chart styles, and layout preferences. This iterative approach ensured that the design
        direction was grounded in user feedback and aligned with psychological research on colour and mood, balancing
        both aesthetics and functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside the wireframes, I built a design system in Figma that defined typography, colour palettes, spacing,
        interactive components, and iconography. This system ensured visual consistency across screens, streamlined the
        design
        process, and allowed for scalable, maintainable design updates. It also supported accessibility standards and
        reinforced
        a cohesive, professional aesthetic, demonstrating attention to detail and strategic design thinking.
      </p>
      <h4>High-Fidelity Prototyping</h4>
      <p>
        With the mid-fidelity wireframes validated, I moved to high-fidelity interactive prototypes. These prototypes
        leveraged
        the design system to create a polished, intuitive, and visually cohesive experience. Special attention was given
        to
        clarity, simplicity, and emotional resonance, ensuring that users could navigate the app easily while feeling
        supported
        in their reflective journaling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, I conducted moderated usability testing with these high-fidelity prototypes. Participants completed
        journaling and
        reflection tasks while I observed their interactions and asked follow-up questions. The feedback highlighted
        areas for
        improvement in navigation, chart interactivity, and onboarding clarity. One key insight was that users valued
        supportive, calm visuals and minimal friction over feature-rich complexity, reinforcing the principle of
        simplicity
        first, engagement second.
      </p>
      <h4>Iterative Refinement & Final Prototype</h4>
      <p>
        Throughout the process, I iterated on the prototypes, refining interface components and interactions based on
        user
        observations. For example, pie charts were redesigned to clearly show which segments could be tapped for
        detailed
        insights, and onboarding text was shortened and made more digestible. Every change was guided by user needs,
        usability
        principles, and the design system, ensuring that the final design was both functional and emotionally
        considerate.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of this process, Feelgraph emerged as a user-centered, visually consistent, and interactive
        prototype,
        reflecting a careful balance of research insights, iterative design, and ethical considerations. The project
        demonstrated how structured research, iterative ideation, and a robust design system can directly inform
        thoughtful and
        effective UX/UI design.
