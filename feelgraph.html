        <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>
        Mental wellbeing is declining worldwide, particularly among young adults. Research shows that expressive writing — writing openly about our thoughts and feelings — can improve both emotional wellbeing and physical health.</p>
        <p>The challenge is that analysing diary entries manually is time-consuming, making it hard to identify patterns in mood and wellbeing.
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        Feelgraph is a concept for an iOS app that combines expressive writing with personal analytics, helping users reflect on their mood patterns through simple, clear data visualisation.

      <h2>My Role</h2>
        <h4>UX Research and UI Design</h4>
        <p>
  Research, wireframes, design system, high-fidelity prototype (Figma)
        </p>
        <h4>Development</h4>
        <p>
         Implemented a working iOS prototype with core features using Swift

      <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <h4>Research</h4>
    <p>
      Conducted user interviews, surveys, and competitive analysis to understand the pain points 
      and needs of users in tracking moods and emotions.
    </p>
    <h4>Ideation</h4>
    <p>
      Created sketches and low-fidelity wireframes, exploring different ways to visualise personal 
      data while keeping the interface intuitive and engaging.
    </p>

    <h4>Design System</h4>
    <p>
      Developed a cohesive set of UI components and patterns in Figma to ensure consistency 
      across the app, including typography, color palette, and interactive elements.
    </p>
    <h4>Prototyping</h4>
    <p>
      Built high-fidelity prototypes in Figma and tested interactive flows, iterating based 
      on feedback to refine usability and visual clarity.
    </p>

      <p>
        I started designing the application by brainstorming and drawing out
        different ideas on paper. I came up with a lot of interesting features,
        but I didn't end up using all of them in the final version. The rough
        sketches I made were really helpful in figuring out what I wanted for
        the app. I used those sketches to make a digital version of the app
        using Figma, a high fidelity prototype. The digital version was built on
        top of the original sketches, and it turned out much better than I was
        expecting.

      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        The project is presently under development. I have completed the
        literature review and research phases and am currently in the design
        stage. The development of the project has not yet commenced. Please
        check back in July for updates on the progress.
